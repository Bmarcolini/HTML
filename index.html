	<h2>#FifteenFighter Jorel Ware: Fight for 15 Leader in New York</h2>

	<p>When Jorel Ware, 36, was arrested for going on strike and stopping the traffic on New York City's 8th Avenue in November 2012, his supervisors at McDonald's laughed at him.</p>
	<p>"They said they couldn't believe I was so stupid," he said. Almost four years later, Ware is the one who's laughing.</p>
	<p>He's one of the leaders of the Fight for 15, a movement that has spread all over the US and is changing low-wage worker's lives.</p>
	<p>"We've changed the whole concept of living wage," said Ware. "We're changing the world."</p>
	<p>Ware's sentence is not overestimated. After achieving raises for fast-food workers, the movement's ambitions grew. In 2016, California and New York approved plans for raising the minimum wage to $15/hour, putting more pressure for a raise in the federal minimum wage - which is backed by democrat senator Bernie Sanders.</p>
	<p>Ware's days start at 1am, when he leaves his parent's house in the Bronx to work at his night shifts at a McDonald's on Times Square. When the sun is up, it's time for him to join the movement's leaders on meetings and demonstrations.</p>
	<p>"I do it because it's the right thing to do," he said. "What's the point of going to work and not being able to take care of myself?"</p>
	<p>Since the movement started, Ware has traveled to dozens of cities in America and visited unions in France, Germany, Belgium and Brazil. He made a tattoo on his right arm with the word believe.</p>
	<p>"I needed to symbolize something that I believe in," he said. "Because I believe that we will win."</p>
